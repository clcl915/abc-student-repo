After reading this article, I realized that I never gave much thought to this topic. In this first section of this reading, it reminded me of a thought I had 4 months ago. When in my early teenage years, I remember putting a fake identity for everything with the same sense of "deep mistrust". I remember saying I was 30 something as my age for my Facebook account when I was really 13. But nowadays, you have to put your real identity. Facebook has this really annoying confirmation when you get locked out of your account like: please add your ID picture or another form of identification.

When I was reading through the article, I highlighted "both virtual and actual are equally real." I was really surprised to read this line because I never thought about them as equal. I think I thought of the virtual world as an addition to the actual world, that it was something like actual world > virtual world. This article also sparked in my head when I was watching Free Guy yesterday. Where a NPC character becomes "real" and changes his whole destiny by being the first character generated by AI in the movie. I don't want to spoil the movie, but it reminded me of AGNES in the text. Where AGNES is still initially programmed but slowly grows with more information from AI.
