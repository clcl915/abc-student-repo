After reading both of Lialina's articles, I had a wave of nostalgia from 2008 to 2010 period. I remember growing up and seeing the same animations, glitter, and backgrounds that she was referencing, especially on The Vernacular Web 2 article. I found both of these essays fascinating because it was like a blast in the past. I tried to open a couple of links that she included and most of them are long gone. I think Lialina is trying to describe the web when "it belonged to the people," when the online web was a space for personal growth and personal identity. Even from 2005 and 2007 when she wrote her essays, the amateur web was taken over by the professional web with no sense of identity. I liked how she argued that the amateur web had more expression and character. Some websites had starry backgrounds to be futuristic and some had glittery girls. I think some of aspects of the amateur web are still found in today's web but redesigned. For example, the "Under construction" animations are now replaced by 404 pages or "Coming Soon" pages. I found it really ironic when she links her own projects website on the "stars" page and it leads to a 404 page.
